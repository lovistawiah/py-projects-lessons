#the string format method
#the basic use of string format is to replace square braces with the argument in the method in ascending order 

print('My name is {} {}'.format('Lovis','Tawiah'))

#The brackets and characters within them (called format fields) are replaced with the objects passed into the str.format() method. A number in the brackets can be used to refer to the position of the object passed into the str.format() method.

#NOTE: if keyword are used in the square braces,the keyword must be assigned to a value to replace it like variable declaration

#Positional and keyword arguments can be arbitrarily combined

#If you have a really long format string that you donâ€™t want to split up, it would be nice if you could reference the variables to be formatted by name instead of by position. This can be done by simply passing the dict and using square brackets '[]' to access the keys
