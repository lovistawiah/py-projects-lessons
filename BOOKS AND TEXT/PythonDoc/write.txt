I believe that everyone has remarkable in them but that it takes finding
something they truly care about to draw it out. You can’t be remarkable
if you don’t love your environment, your tools, and your domain.
Before I had my spark lit with 37signals and Ruby on Rails, I went
through a series of jobs and gigs that certainly wouldn’t fit the bill as
remarkable. I was treading water and just letting one day eat the next.
Before I knew it, six months were gone, and I didn’t have anything to
show for it.
That’s a terrible feeling of regret. I hate the feeling that my presence
doesn’t really matter and that the world would have been exactly no
different in a meaningful way if my work hadn’t been done. To become
remarkable, you have to believe that you’re making a significant dent
in the universe.
When I wasn’t making a dent at work, it spilled over to my personal
life too. When I didn’t feel like I was having an impact during office
hours, it was that much harder to muster the effort to have an impact
afterward.
To me, leading a remarkable career is the best way I know to kick start
that same desire for leading a remarkable life—one where you don’t
just become a better and more valuable worker, but you become a better human too.
That’s why this book is so important. It’s not just about making better
widgets and feeling secure in your job. It’s just as much about developing the skills and sensibilities for leading a more rewarding life filled
with many remarkable aspects, with work just being one of them.
